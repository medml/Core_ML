# Core_ML
This is where you'll find the notebooks we consider 'core' to learning medicine-relevant ML.

## Introductions
We'll have a set of introductory notebooks focused on interactively understanding ML and how it differs from what came before.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is the workhorse of ML so we'll spend a decent amount of time/effort on linear regression.
But in a fun way.

## Logistic/Classification
Being able to tell which 'group' a dataset belongs to is largely what we're taught in medical school.
Symptoms = Data, and Groups = Diseases.
Using ML to assist us in this by seeing patterns that we can't easily see is a perfect starting point for us to understand ML.

## Deep Learning
Where all the 'excitement' seems to be happening in modern ML.
We'll have some simple notebooks meant to highlight how DL goes beyond traditional ML by using powerful computers.
Naturally, it'll be tough to run these live in a workshop so we'll be relying on other resources to bridge you towards full understanding.

## Ethics and Bias in Medical ML
ML is a powerful tool and, like any tool, it can do as much harm as it can good.
Being able to understand the limitations of ML algorithms is critical to properly using it in patientcare.
Better understanding the role of the physician in the process, in turn, can help us figure out the best ML-tools to address our patient's specific needs.
